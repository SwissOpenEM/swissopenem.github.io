![OpenEM logo](/assets/img/logo-wide-1024x317.png){:.center}

OpenEM has a new logo! This O-shaped ring is a protein structure imaged by Mikhail
Kudryashev and colleagues at Biozentrum, Universtity of Basel, using cryo-electron
microscopy.

The bacterium *Vibrio cholerae* uses a syringe-like fiber called the type VI secretion
system to inject effector molecules into other cells. The outside of this fiber is made
up of two proteins, VipA and VipB, which form a helical structure with six spiraling
strands. The logo shows the electron density from a short segment of the sheath.

Data for this image is available from three sources:
- micrographs from EMPAIR: [EMPIAR-10019](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/entry/10019)
- reconstructed 3D electron density from EMDB: [EMD-2699](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/EMD-2699); and a 
- molecular model from PDB: [3j9g](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/3j9g)
The logo was created from this data using [ChimeraX](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimerax/).

## Sidebar image

The colorful background used in the sidebar is also an electron micrograph. This
crystallographic orientation map was produced by Dr. Karsten Kunze and Dr. Alla
Sologubenko using Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction (TKD). The colors show the
orientation of each crystal domain in this nanocrystalline Titanium sample (TEM foil).
