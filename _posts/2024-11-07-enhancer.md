OpenEM had a strong showing at the [EnhanceR Symposium
2024](https://web.archive.org/web/20241107100119/https://symposium.enhancer.ch/). This
is a great event for Swiss research IT providers, and this year's theme of 'Research IT
contribution to FAIRness' was highly relevant to OpenEM's mission. Slides from Spencer's
show-and-tell presentation are available from
[zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/14049901).
