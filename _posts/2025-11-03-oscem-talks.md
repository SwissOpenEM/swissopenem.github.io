The _[Open Science Community for Electron Microscopy
(OSC-EM)](https://github.com/osc-em)_ has been working for more than a year on developing
interoperable standards for EM data. OpenEM has been a major contributor to this effort,
along with other partners at the [INSTRUCT Image Processing Center](https://i2pc.es/),
[EMPL-EBI](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/), and other researchers.

Recent updates on OSC-EM were presented at the [2025 Scipion for Facilities
Workshop](https://i2pc.es/facilities-2025/) and the
[ETH Domain Data Stewardship Community Event](https://www.lib4ri.ch/fall-2025-eth-domain-data-stewardship-community-event).

Recent developments include

- A new general-use schema suitable for material science
- The [material science metadata extractor](https://github.com/SwissOpenEM/MS_Metadata_reader), supporting .emd and .prz metadata
- The [life science extractor](https://github.com/SwissOpenEM/LS_Metadata_reader/), supporting SerialEM, EPU, and Tomo5
- The new 'processing' section for single particle CryoEM (with [Scipion](https://scipion.i2pc.es/) support under development)

The OSC-EM format is used for all data ingested with OpenEM. If you are interested in more information or want help using OSC-EM on your microscope, get in contact with us through the [OSC-EM mailing list](https://listas.csic.es/cnb/wws/info/oscem) or start a discussion on our [github organization](https://github.com/orgs/osc-em/discussions).

Slides are available from both workshops:

- [FAIR data collection with the Open Science Community for Electron Microscopy (OSC-EM) metadata standard](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17484452)
- [FAIR Standards for Electron Microscopy Data](https://zenodo.org/records/17542839)
