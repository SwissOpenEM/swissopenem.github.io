The Open EM Data Network (OpenEM) is a consortium of Swiss electron microscopy facilities working together to:

- Improve Open Research Data (ORD) practices in the Swiss EM community
- Provide an open and [FAIR](https://force11.org/info/the-fair-data-principles/) repository for Swiss EM data not hosted elsewhere
- Standardize EM metadata & automate collection at Swiss EM facilities
- Follow a consistent data lifecycle when collecting data at different facilities
- Streamline publication of EM data into open repositories like EMPIAR, EMDB, and the PDB
