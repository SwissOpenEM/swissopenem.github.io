### Core software projects ###

| Core Software components | Description | Part of |
|---------|------|---------|
| Metadata Extractor | Performs automatic metadata extraction directly on the instrument. This means that it is no longer necessary for end users to analyse and enter metadata manually. | Metadata Standards |
| Ingestor | Software that handles the transfer between faculties and SciCat and the LTS. The end user can select the data set to be transferred via a web interface and the rest is carried out automatically in the background. | Metadata Standards |
| Archival and Retrieval | The infrastructure that enables the archiving and retrieval of EM data. As things stand at present, this is provided by PSI and ETHZ. | Scicat Metadata Catalog |
| SciCat | SciCat is the public catalogue for managing, uploading and obtaining EM data. It is open source software hosted by PSI. | Scicat Metadata Catalog |
| Authentication Infrastructure | The authentication infrastructure enables log-in with university users. In addition, a separate role administration is planned to enable cross-faculty collaboration. | Scicat Metadata Catalog |
| Repository Integration | Integrates with international repositories for data deposition. | Deposition in International Repositories |
| Education | Provides user training, outreach, and sustainability efforts. | User Training, Outreach and Sustainability |
