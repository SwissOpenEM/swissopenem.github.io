## Download a dataset

This chapter explains how to request and download a dataset from SciCat.

### Login to Scicat

Log in to <a href="https://discovery.psi.ch/login">SciCat</a> with your organisation user.

### Select the dataset and add it to the cart

After logging in, the dataset view can be opened by clicking on the SciCat logo.

### Retrieve the dataset

As soon as a data set is in the shopping basket, actions can be called up. One action is called Retrieval, which can be used to request the download of a data set.

{% include gallery.html image="/assets/img/documentation/user/dataset_download_5.png" alt="SciCat Select Dataset in Cart" caption="Figure 5: SciCat Select Dataset in Cart" width="60%" %}
{% include gallery.html image="/assets/img/documentation/user/dataset_download_6.png" alt="SciCat Retrieve Dataset" caption="Figure 6: SciCat Retrieve Dataset" width="60%" %}

The data record is now transferred from the long-term storage to a cache server. As soon as the transfer is complete, the user is informed by e-mail. A download link is provided in the e-mail.
