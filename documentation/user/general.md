## SciCat

For the user, [SciCat](https://discovery.psi.ch/login), which is hosted by PSI, is the entry point for searching, transferring and downloading datasets.

All actions can be started and the datasets managed via the web interface. SciCat can be accessed from any network. The individual ingestor can only be accessed within the university network.

### OpenEM from the user's point of view

The user does not have to worry about which components are used by which different institutions. SciCat and the university's own ingestor are particularly relevant for them.

The ingestor is selected directly via the web frontend. When transferring data, however, it must be ensured that the ingestor is accessible.
